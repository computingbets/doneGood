Through our partnership, Nomi designed and developed a product line that is made by survivors, which Nomi markets globally. The women receive competitive wages and medical care. All proceeds from Nomi’s product sales are invested in improving benefits, training, and career development programs, as well as capacity building and market access. Prior to receiving Nomi’s technical assistance and initial order of bags, the local social enterprise had been planning to shut down due to insufficient product demand coupled with the downturn in the garment manufacturing industry. That would have resulted in 23 women losing their jobs. Our initial order allowed them to keep their doors open and women employed. By 2011, as a result of increased demand for bags created by Nomi's marketing efforts, our partner was able to increase the number of employed survivors to 80 and in 2012, Nomi was able to help the social enterprise secure an order from Walmart, one of the largest global retailers.",

Through our partnership, Nomi designed and developed a product line that is made by survivors, which Nomi markets globally. The women receive competitive wages and medical care. All proceeds from Nomi’s product sales are invested in improving benefits, training, and career development programs, as well as capacity building and market access. Prior to receiving Nomi’s technical assistance and initial order of bags, the local social enterprise had been planning to shut down due to insufficient product demand coupled with the downturn in the garment manufacturing industry. That would have resulted in 23 women losing their jobs. Our initial order allowed them to keep their doors open and women employed. By 2011, as a result of increased demand for bags created by Nomi's marketing efforts, our partner was able to increase the number of employed survivors to 80 and in 2012, Nomi was able to help the social enterprise secure an order from Walmart, one of the largest global retailers.",

Married at sixteen to an abusive man, she struggled to create a peaceful home for her 7 children. “The most devastating period of my life happened when he passed away of AIDS and his family accused me of his death. They evicted me.”\n\nSince joining our partner initiative, the Namugongo Good Samaritan Project, Safina's outlook has changed dramatically. 100% dedicated to bead and basket-weaving, she wants you to know from her heart:\n“I love you very much. I reach out to say thank you for buying.”\n\nPICTURES: 1. Safina taking a break from rolling her beads to laugh with Circle of Hands' founder Linda 2. Cooking at the communal oven which is very smoky and hot--not a healthful way to cook. The yellow cans you see are used to collect well-water a mile away traveled by foot. Since there is no running water for showers or baths, a Ugandan living in poverty sponge bathes standing in a plastic pan like the purple one in the photo. 3. Safina's \"house\" is the 10'x10' room behind the doorway on the right.",

Through our partnership, Nomi designed and developed a product line that is made by survivors, which Nomi markets globally. The women receive competitive wages and medical care. All proceeds from Nomi’s product sales are invested in improving benefits, training, and career development programs, as well as capacity-building and market access. Prior to receiving Nomi’s technical assistance and the initial order of bags, the local social enterprise had been planning to shut down due to insufficient product demand coupled with the downturn in the garment manufacturing industry. That would have resulted in 23 women losing their jobs. Our initial order allowed them to keep their doors open and women employed. By 2011, as a result of increased demand for bags created by Nomi's marketing efforts, our partner was able to increase the number of employed survivors to 80 and in 2012, Nomi was able to help the social enterprise secure an order from Walmart, one of the largest global retailers.",
