If your natural beauty routine incorporates Konjac Sponges, then your answer is yes. These natural sponges help your face and decollete glow with health and beauty, all while staying 100% biodegradable and eco-friendly. \nKonjac sponges come from the konjac plant, a perennial found in Japan. The konjac is full of the nourishment your skin needs to look its best, including vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and folic acid. Gently washing with these naturally alkaline facial sponges helps to balance your skin’s acidity while enriching it with these vital nutrients. Konjac sponges exfoliate as they cleanse, helping to remove dead skin cells and encouraging the growth of new ones. The result? Smooth, glowing skin free of toxins and impurities.\nWe know not all skin is the same, which is why we’ve added a second Konjac sponge for the price of one. Is your skin sensitive, dry, or a combination type? Use the white sponge. If you’re prone to acne, use the black sponge once a week for an even deeper cleaning. You’ll be amazed at the way these tiny sponges will leave your skin clear, silky, and smooth.\n\nIt’s time to do something special for your skin – and for yourself! Take a few minutes out of your day with our all hydrating face mask. Carefully formulated to extract the deep rooted dirt and grime that lead to clogged pores, our natural facial mask is sure to leave your skin looking clean, bright, smooth, and hydrated.\n\nNurture your skin with our witch hazel and rose petal water facial toner.

If your natural beauty routine incorporates Konjac Sponges, then your answer is yes. These natural sponges help your face and decollete glow with health and beauty, all while staying 100% biodegradable and eco-friendly. \nKonjac sponges come from the konjac plant, a perennial found in Japan. The konjac is full of the nourishment your skin needs to look its best, including vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and folic acid. Gently washing with these naturally alkaline facial sponges helps to balance your skin’s acidity while enriching it with these vital nutrients. Konjac sponges exfoliate as they cleanse, helping to remove dead skin cells and encouraging the growth of new ones. The result? Smooth, glowing skin free of toxins and impurities.\nWe know not all skin is the same, which is why we’ve added a second Konjac sponge for the price of one. Is your skin sensitive, dry, or a combination type? Use the white sponge. If you’re prone to acne, use the black sponge once a week for an even deeper cleaning. You’ll be amazed at the way these tiny sponges will leave your skin clear, silky, and smooth.\n\nWho needs the sun for an amazing tan? Not you!
