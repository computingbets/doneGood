We agonized and analyzed as we added each gram of plastic to the product to arrive at the perfect balance of sturdiness while minimizing the amount of precious recycled resources we used. Material isn't the only thing that creates strength and durability; the curved line that sweeps across the bowl that makes all the difference in its strength. Learn more about how we designed the Everyday line in this case study found here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFeatures: \n\n\n\t16 oz. bowl\n\tDesigned to last. Reuse forever (or return it to us and we will).\n\tCurved shape for improved sturdiness\n\t100% recycled, BPA and melamine free\n\n\nDescription:\n\nPreserve Everyday Tableware is perfect for everything from casual family meals to al fresco dining. The plates have been specially designed for ease of use, shaped and weighted for stability and resistance to spills. They are also designed to be dishwasher safe and durable enough to last decades–they can literally be used thousands of times. For this reason, we chose a textured material on the plate to hide utensil marks. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t",
